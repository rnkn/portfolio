I released another package for GNU Emacs, [side-notes]. The program simply
displays a side window displaying `side-notes-file` in the current directory,
which defaults to `notes.txt`. The idea being that you can keep notes for any
project in a simple text file, quickly accessible. The name of the notes file
can be set per-project with a [Per-Directory Local Variable][dir] or [File
Variable][file].

Available on [MELPA-stable](https://stable.melpa.org/#/side-notes) and
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/#/side-notes).
