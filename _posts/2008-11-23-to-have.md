A lonesome young man receives a visit from his ex-girlfriend, and through
faltering emotional gestures and clumsy honesty they come to terms with the end
of their relationship.

> In its smallness, its whiteness and its location hovering over a city, we
> could almost be in Tokyo. It is a perfect place for an alienated modern youth
> to brood. And when two people are in the apartment, there is immediate erotic
> potential: where else can they sit but on the bed?
> 
> Brisbane actors Daria Westerman and Nicholas Turner give sensitive portrayals
> of the lovers. The naturalistic, close filming brings viewers voyeuristically
> into the room. It is a controlled, poignant performance by cast and crew ---
> a remarkable debut performance for a new film-maker.
