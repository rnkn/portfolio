  New video for Lawrence English, "Forgiving Noir".
---

Single-channel video loop in support of
[Lawrence English][lpe]{:target="_blank"} album _Wilderness of Mirrors_
(2 min 26 sec).

> And as seen in the new video for "Forgiving Noir," Lawrence English hasn't
> lost his pension for pensive patience. As the focal character, this woman
> with a branch possesses an intriguing strength in terms of initiative and
> stamina.  She also harnesses a certain mystery that is also pleasantly hidden
> within Lawrence's track "Forgiving Noir." What is this forgiveness all about?
> How does the noir light transpire upon this specific situation?
>
> Maybe what's happening is this woman with a branch: she's encircling the
> video AND the wilderness itself. If Lawrence English's newest album title
> Wilderness of Mirrors has anything to say about the video, the woman with a
> branch IS just entombed within a lengthy trail of similar scenery. If I
> consider anything outside of Clint Eastwood's take on the "genre" noir ---
> eh, fuck it, include Clint Eastwood --- "Forgiving Noir" reads more toward
> the suspenseful aspect of noir lighting (as we all know the lighting came
> well before any sort of detective sleuth sub-genre took the word's meaning),
> and flips the typical idea of the protagonist as the one cracking a mystery,
> as the VIEWERS (and listeners of the track) are the ones searching for
> meaning.
