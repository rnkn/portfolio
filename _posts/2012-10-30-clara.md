Narrative short film (15 min).

_When Clara mistakenly receives a collection of photographs of another woman's
entire life, she leaves her husband and life of luxury and heads west. As she
indulges in a self-constructed narrative of the lost girl searching for
answers, the further Clara travels the less meaning she finds._

> A moving, engaging film whose strength lies in the questions that remain
> unanswered. A very impressive piece of work.
>
> -- Mark Overett, Producer (_Iron Sky_, _Unfinished Sky_)
