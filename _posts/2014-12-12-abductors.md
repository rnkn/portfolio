In the depths of the Honduran jungle, a misanthropic foreign aid doctor,
reeling from the loss of his family, must lead a village of Miskito natives in
a fight for survival against malevolent child-snatching creatures, and, in the
process, find redemption.

> Much like _Jaws_ in the jungle, the story takes its time in revealing the
> monsters, which is very effective. What's more important, however, is that
> the story remains character-driven even in the midst of violent, uncertain
> chaos; Clark and every other character in the story have a true purpose and
> organic motivations. The underlying thematic conflict between faith and
> science is very well delineated in the story and the script isn't afraid to
> show both the shortcomings and advantages of both philosophical sides.
