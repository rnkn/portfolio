  performance at Dark Mofo at Odeon Theatre, Hobart. (Sold out.)
---

Video projection for [Lawrence English][lpe]{:target="_blank"}. Rework of
segment of _Night of the Living Dead_ (1968).

> _The Visitors_ is a 50 minute audio visual homage to Romero's remarkable film.
> It is a mediation on the zombie as cultural phenomena. Using one of the iconic
> zombie montages from the original film, which is drawn out from a few seconds
> to 50 minutes; the images on screen shift from objects of horror to a
> dreamlike light play. The faces and bodies of the undead become a focus of
> attention, something to be explored rather than shunned. Their on screen
> presence shifts from fear and disgust to a kind of glacial beauty. Matched
> with an embodied soundtrack of low frequency vibration and harmonic echoes,
> _The Visitors_ is a work that celebrates Romero's criticisms of modern systems
> of economy and power and recognises the role and value of the body as more
> than just flesh for consumption.
