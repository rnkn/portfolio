I have a new video work exhibiting as part of the [Brisbane Fringe Festival][1].
The work is an immersive 2-channel projection in the intimate Skukum Lounge
space at The Junk Bar. The video work screens as part of three collaborative
performance pieces of [_It Will Find You_][2], the 2nd annual _What We Do In The
Dark_ event.

Both the event and the space are inspired by the Sasquatch mythology.

Wednesday, 26 August, 7pm & 9pm performances @ [The Junk Bar][3], Ashgrove.

Tickets $15 from [Sticky Tickets][2].
