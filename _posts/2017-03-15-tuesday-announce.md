I'm very happy to direct your attention to [A Particular Tuesday][1], an
audio-visual social-cultural visual poem... or, if you'd prefer, music video,
for Norman Westberg (of New York post-everything band SWANS) for the release of
his album _Jasper Sits Out_.

Lawrence English of Room40 asked me if I'd like to do the video back in November
last year, around the particular Tuesday we were all looking at the news and
feeling our hearts slowly breaking. So with this one I wanted to do something
more, an 11-minute tome that spoke to what human life means on planet earth
right now. It is wonderful to collaborate with people who trust you to deliver
basically anything.

The film is now streaming exclusively on [Tiny Mix Tapes][2].

p.s. Thanks Francis Thompson, Jill Rankin, Amber Stewart, and Dan Rice who all
helped with the film.
