I just re-watched _The Matrix_. When Neo visits the Oracle and accidentally
breaks her vase, she asks would he still have broken it if she hadn't said
anything. Then she proceeds to tell him that he's not "The One", which we all
take to be misdirection, and that she's just telling him what he needs to hear.

But what if he really wasn't The One? The film has already told us that neither
Morpheus nor Neo believe in fate. What if it is purely Morpheus's belief in Neo,
and Neo's subsequent belief in himself, and finally Trinity's love, that
transforms him into The One? ðŸ¤¯
