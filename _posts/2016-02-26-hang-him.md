It gives me great pleasure to announce the release of
_Hang Him When He Is Not There_, the debut novel/collection by one of my closest
friends, a writer I consider among the very best living writers, Nicholas John
Turner.

Sometime last year Nicholas came to me with a Microsoft Word document and asked
how we might turn this into a book --- a real thing that might live on bookshelves
and in the hands of commuters and cafÃ© patrons and drowsy night owls. So began
the arduous journey of layout, typesetting, and revisions upon revisions, until
he and I felt the book was ready for the world.

It is without exaggeration that I say I consider this a work of genius. Reading
the collection instils equal parts wistfulness and dread. Despite the deft
omission of any immediate violence (physical or otherwise) there is a persistent
sense we're skirting the exterior of some horrible development that can never be
completely grasped. It's like checking into some remote motel where through the
wall you can hear the dull and indistinct sounds of a terrible argument.
Highbrow for sure, poignant and brilliant.

From the official announcement on publisher [Savage Motif][1]:

> ...each of these elusive stories emerges from its narrator's mind and works
> its way under the reader's skin. From a Centenarian stuck in a shrinking
> Parisian apartment, to twins arranging escorts on the Caribbean Coast; in
> place of clear narratives, straightforward logic, and neatly extractable
> meaning, Turner imposes the strange and irreducible philosophies of his
> marginal narrators. The effect is a series of curious and intimate profiles
> that brings an unnerving denominator to the surface, and takes the reader
> where mere pointing will not.

Available on [Amazon][2] and at the following local and international
independent booksellers: [Avid Reader][3] (West End), [Little Gnome][4]
