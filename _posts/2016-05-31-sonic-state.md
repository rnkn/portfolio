I'm very excited to announce I will be doing a live video performance at
[Sonic State Queensland Week Microfestival][1] next Thursday (9 June) in
collaboration with one of my favourite people, the ARIA Award winning musician
and all-round great human [Heinz Riegler].

Rather than do a musical show with some ancillary video projection, Heinz and I
are approaching this as a combined audio-visual experience; the space is
[an amazing old cinema][2] with fantastic floor-to-ceiling projection, so it
should be really something special.

We will be supporting another one of my favourite people, [Lawrence English] in
one of his rare hometown performances. (I anticipate this will be loud.)

Sonic State Queensland Week Microfestival is a four-day experimental music
festival held at Metro Arts in Brisbane. Tickets for single event admission or
the whole festival are [on sale now][1].
