[New video for HEXA][1] (Lawrence English & Jamie Stewart).

It feels ridiculous to promote a music video today. It feels like September 12.

I could put this off for another day. After I've become more used to the idea of
living in a new fascist age. But that's just the thing isn't it? We all get used
to it. We scroll through our feeds. We're all so *busy*. (Those camps are nothing
like *those* camps.)

Yesterday, when the news started to turn for the worse, I closed all news sites
and went for a walk. There was just no way he could win, so I didn't want to
agonise over fluctuating results trickling in. Better to just see her victory
speech at the end.

In a park, I sat by a pond and watched the water. Heinz, a close friend,
messaged to ask if I was okay. He told me it was all over. People were still
walking hand-in-hand, laughing, taking selfies, scrolling through their feeds. I
watched the pond and cried.

When something this horrible happens, the progressive left usually respond with
calls for compassion and perseverance. "If we all work together..." etc. There is
a stubborn optimism (the same stubborn optimism that said he could never win).
But I just feel heartbroken. The US president-elect is a psychopath, and there
is a very real possibility that he will destroy everyone we know and love within
his years in office. Let that sink in.

But then there's the heartbreak at the banal cruelty of humanity. That people
allowed such bottomless hatred to govern them. When you see a stranger, you need
to believe that that person shares the same interior humanity as you --- this
person, like you, could not identify their support with a monster. Yesterday we
all lost that.

I keep wondering what it was like when this happened in Germany. When their
chancellor was appointed did people use the word "evil" to describe him, or did
that only come after? Now it is after. We have hindsight.

Good luck.
