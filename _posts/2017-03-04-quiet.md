I've recently finished a screenplay called [_Quiet on Earth_][1]. It's set in a
desolate post-apocalyptic world. A lone man treks across barren landscape in
search of a missing woman, while a figure stalks him from a distance.

There is no dialogue and the characters do not have names. It is a distillation
down to fundamental elements. I wanted to carve something right down to the
bone. A film in haiku... like stretching the thin membrane of human hope against
the void.

So if you're interested to read it, please let me know.
