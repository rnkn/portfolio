  Edited an alternate version of _Blade Runner_.
---

An alternate cut of _Blade Runner_ that fixes small issues I've always had with
one of my favourite films.

The cut is the international theatrical cut (i.e. including voice-over) with
some minor changes. Where I included footage from _Blade Runner: The Final Cut_
I've corrected the colour grade to match the original.

- Added improved audio from _The Final Cut_ of Bryan's line "I've got four skin
  jobs walking the streets."
- Added audio from _The Final Cut_ of Bryant saying two replicants were killed
  running through an electrical field.
- Added footage from _The Final Cut_ of the serial number on the snake scale to
  match dialogue.
- Added footage from _The Final Cut_ of Joanna Cassidy's digital face
  replacement in Zhora's death scene.
- Removed Gaff's repeated "It's too bad she won't live..." line when Deckard
  sees the origami unicorn.
- Removed epilogue of Deckard and Rachael driving. The film now cuts straight to
  black at the elevator.
- No stupid unicorn dream.
