Brisbane people: Next Thursday, 14 April, [Norman Westberg][1] will be
performing for [MONO 21][2] at the Institute of Modern Art. The show will
feature a 45-minute reworking of one my video pieces playing throughout, which
was originally used for the [Bunny Bill video][3]. The show is free but has
limited capacity, so make sure to get a seat early (start time is 7:00pm).
