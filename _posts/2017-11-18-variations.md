> "Variations on Leonard French" was originally commissioned as a live
> film and music performance, in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary
> of La&nbsp;Trobe University in 2017. The work is based on the
> sculptural piece by noted Australian artist Leonard French the "The
> Four Seasons", acquired by the University in 1978 in recognition of
> the contribution of David Myers, inaugural Vice Chancellor. This
> contemporary reimagining of French's vision, created for the explicit
> purpose of acknowledging the visual fabric of the University, should
> be preserved within the cultural collections of the institution for
> posterity.
