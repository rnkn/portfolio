Pretty excited about this one. My latest video project, [Bunny Bill][1], a
10-minute work for Norman Westberg of seminal New York experimental
post-punk-post-new-wave-post-post band Swans is now online. The video also had a
cool premiere up on [FACT Magazine][2] a few days ago, and they called it
hypnotic and gorgeous, so that was very nice of them.

Please do experience.

The video is in support of Westberg's wide release of first solo album _13_,
available via [Room40][3].
