One day Mark Zuckerberg was ordering coffee at his favourite coffee place on
the Facebook campus. While he was stirring in his sugar a pigeon flying
overhead defecated right in his cup! He couldn't believe his bad luck.

The barista stifled a laugh and quickly made him a replacement coffee. "You're
Mark Zuckerberg," he said, "I'm sure you could figure out a way to make it so
the pigeons around here didn't poop."

Mark chuckled and said, "That's crazy," but as he took the new coffee and
walked away he couldn't shake the thought. Was it really that crazy?
