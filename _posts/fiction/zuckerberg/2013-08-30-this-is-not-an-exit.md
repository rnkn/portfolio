Mark Zuckerberg kept a copy of _American Psycho_ in his desk drawer. His
favourite chapters were marked with coloured Post-Its. Sometimes in the middle
hours of the afternoon he would go into his private bathroom and look into his
reflection and recite the final few sentences in a low hushed tone.

He stepped out of the bathroom and Françoise who was already waiting in the
frame of his office door asked if she could run the new databasing schemas on
Friday's development briefing and he stopped and aimed his gaze at her confused
moon-shaped face and said, "This is not an exit Françoise."
