It was late into the evening, maybe one or two A.M. and maybe six or even eight
of the potent pineapple-flavoured Conquistador cocktails down when Mark
Zuckerberg decided that fuck it he would try _Dance Dance Revolution_. A
handful of his employees had been playing for the last three or four hours
while Mark had been sitting in the booth, nodding along to inconsequential
conversations and watching the group laugh and jump around on the colourful
glowing foot sensors. So, shakily he stood and drained the remnants of his
Conquistador through the twirly straw that barely remained in the wide-rimmed
glass and approached the arcade machine. "Who's up next?" he blurted out as the
group parted to allow his advance but no one spoke and the machine continued
its pounding beat and chimes of success and failure as Adrienne Bard from the
UX team divided her attention between keeping step with the cascading coloured
arrows and Mark standing behind her.

"Uh, you can go next man," Sam Henderman said, "if you want." Sam had a large
brown mole in the spot between his eyebrows and Mark fixed his attention at
this protruding orb as he felt his body sway like one of those bobble-head dogs
suburban soccer mothers affix to their car dashboards.

"I will go next, Sam," Mark said, never taking his eyes off Sam's mole.
