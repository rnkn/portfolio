# Writing Tools

Below are some writing tools I maintain for the GNU Emacs platform.

## [Fountain Mode][]

the plain-text [Fountain][] markup format. 

## [Olivetti][]

A GNU Emacs program to interactively adjust and balance the window
margins to provide for a nice writing environment.

## [Side Notes][]

A GNU Emacs program to allow easy access to a `notes.txt` file in a side
window.
