Currently in Brisbane, Australia. These are the things I'm working on:

- Writing a post-apocalyptic screenplay without dialogue called _Quiet on Earth_.
- Organising my video works into a collection suitable for my first gallery shows.
- Incrementally improving [Fountain Mode](/fountain-mode/) to make it one of the
  best screenwriting programs in the world.
- Gathering together the threads for a novel called _Midland Thicket_ about a
  Midwestern town sheriff with an unshakeable sense of foreboding.
- Writing the first syllabus for [The Human School](http://human.school), a
  worldwide happiness project applying intersubjective aesthetic practice.
- Embracing a minimalist lifestyle by reducing all of my things (possessions,
  projects, commitments, etc.) to the bare essentials.
- Learning meditation.
