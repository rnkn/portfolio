Hello. My name's Paul W. Rankin and I'm a filmmaker based in Brisbane,
Australia. I started using the "W." around the time George W. Bush invaded Iraq.
LOL.

I call myself a [filmmaker] (rather than director, producer, etc.) because
I usually do everything by myself. This is mostly through necessity because no
one wants to hire me anymore. My greatest strength is my artistic integrity, which is
indistinguishable from years of calcified rationalisation that anyone more
successful than me has sold out. With my sharp critical eye, I'm able to find
fault with almost everything. I inspire in others an unshakeable suspicion that
I'm a fraud.

Instead of film school, I studied philosophy. My aim was to understand the role
of art beyond simple self-expression. My bookshelf is brimming with potential
knowledge---almost one-third through [_Being and Time_][bt]{:target="_blank"}!

Proficient at staring at ceilings.

I should have written more [screenplays] by now. I should be writing now.

More recently, my unhealthy relationship towards other people's attention has
spurred a foray into [live performance].

I'm very skilled at creating unpaid, time-sucking jobs for myself as a method of
avoidance, like developing an open-source [screenwriting program][fountain]{:target="_blank"}
for [GNU Emacs][emacs]{:target="_blank"} (a platform [hardly anyone uses][so]{:target="_blank"}),
or launching a [blog about cinema and filmmaking][filmpo]{:target="_blank"} with a couple of
friends just because, or making meaningless [cosmetic changes][archive]{:target="_blank"}
to this site.

Also, I copied the idea for this bio [from a friend][brodie]{:target="_blank"}.

Bio for PR people
-----------------

Paul W. Rankin (b. 1984) is a filmmaker and video artist based in Brisbane,
Australia. His live visual practice employs layers of continuously mixed video
to create a space that hangs in the balance between the abstract and
representational. His visuals are created from practical effects, using no CGI.
He has collaborated with world-renowned musicians and sound artists including
Lawrence English, Norman Westberg (Swans), and Heinz Riegler. His work has
screened in Australia, Austria, Germany, Serbia, and the United States. He
obtained his Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Queensland in
