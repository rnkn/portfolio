Hello. My name's Paul W. Rankin and I'm a filmmaker based in Brisbane,
Australia. I started using the "W." around the time George W. Bush invaded Iraq.
LOL.

I call myself a filmmaker, rather than a [director][], [editor][], etc. because
I usually do everything by myself. This is mostly through necessity because no
one wants to hire me. My greatest strength is my artistic integrity, which is
indistinguishable from years of calcified rationalisation that anyone more
successful than me has sold out. With my sharp critical eye, I'm able to find
fault with almost everything. I inspire in others an unshakeable suspicion that
I'm a fraud.

Instead of film school, I studied philosophy. My aim was to understand the role
of art beyond simple self-expression. My bookshelf is brimming with potential
knowledge---almost to the one-third point of [_Being and Time_][bt]!

Proficient at staring at ceilings.

I should have written more [screenplays][] by now. I should be writing now.

More recently, my unhealthy relationship towards other people's attention has
spurred a foray into [live performance][].

I'm very skilled at creating unpaid, time-sucking jobs for myself as a method of
avoidance, like developing an open-source [screenwriting program][fountain] for
[GNU Emacs][emacs] (a platform [hardly anyone uses][so]), or launching a
[blog about cinema and filmmaking][filmpo] with a couple of friends just
because, or making meaningless [cosmetic changes][archive] to this site.

Also, I copied the idea for this bio [from a friend][brodie].
