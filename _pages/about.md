Hello. My name's Paul W. Rankin and I'm a filmmaker based in Brisbane,
Australia. I started using the "W." around the time George W. Bush invaded Iraq.
LOL.

I am proficient at staring at ceilings.

Bio for PR people
-----------------

Paul W. Rankin (b. 1984) is a filmmaker and video artist based in Brisbane,
Australia. His live visual practice employs layers of continuously mixed video
to create a space that hangs in the balance between the abstract and
representational. His visuals are created from practical effects, using no CGI.
He has collaborated with world-renowned musicians and sound artists including
Lawrence English, Norman Westberg (Swans), and Heinz Riegler. His work has
screened in Australia, Austria, Germany, Serbia, and the United States. He
obtained his Bachelor's degree in Philosophy from the University of Queensland in
2013.
