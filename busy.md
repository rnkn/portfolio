Everyone thinks they're busy. No one is really busy, or we wouldn't have
Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, etc. If we were really busy, the companies
that feed off our wasted time would have no means of existing.

So why do you think you're busy?

Vanity. The capilistic system survives by extracting more value from the
individual than it gives back. In order to do this it needs to create a
social illusion of value. Working hard makes you "a valuable employee".
This illusion of social value allows the system to under-pay you for
your work. Appealing to your vanity is cheaper than appealing to your
bank balance.

This simple calculation eludes most people.

If you don't believe this, ask yourself what you've really accomplished
in the last year. Probably nothing of note. All of that scrambling
around, the emails, the meetings, the projects, with nothing to show for
it.

Busy people don't accomplish anything.
