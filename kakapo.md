## In the news:

### [Vets perform world-first brain surgery on critically endangered kakapo chick in NZ][1]

> New Zealand veterinarians have performed world-first brain surgery to
> save the life of a critically endangered native parrot chick.
>
> Key points:
>
> - There are only 144 of the flightless and nocturnal kakapo left in
>   existence, making the surgery important
>
> - An abnormal growth was discovered in the chick's skull shortly after
>   it hatched
>
> - The veterinary surgeons had no precedent in the avian world, so
>   adapted techniques used on humans and other mammals
