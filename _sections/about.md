Hello. My name's Paul W. Rankin and I'm a filmmaker based in Brisbane,
Australia. I started using the "W." around the time George W. Bush invaded Iraq.
LOL.

I am proficient at staring at ceilings.

Paul W. Rankin (b. 1984) is a filmmaker and video artist based in Brisbane,
Australia. His live visual practice employs layering multiple video tracks to
create something between the abstract and representational. His visuals are
created from practical effects, using no CGI. He has collaborated with
world-renowned musicians and sound artists including [Lawrence English], [Norman
Westberg] (Swans), [Tamil Rogeon], and [Heinz Riegler]. His work has screened in
Australia, Austria, Poland, Germany, Croatia, Serbia, and the United States.

In 2017 he was commissioned to create the video work [_Variations on Leonard
French_][var] to commemorate La Trobe University's 50th anniversary. The work
premiered with the Australian Youth Orchestra. Also that year, his work was used
to announce the [Dark Mofo] festival.

In 2012 he was selected for the QPIX White Heat funding grant to write and
direct the short film [Clara].

The Queensland New Filmmakers Awards nominated his work in 2009 and 2010.

Also a screenwriter, he has written two feature spec screenplays and created his
own [screenwriting software] for the [Fountain] markup language.

In 2013 he obtained his Bachelorâ€™s degree in Philosophy from the University of
Queensland.
