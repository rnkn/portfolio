### Olivetti Lettera 32 typewriter

### turntable & stereo

### [Traverler's Notebook][1]

Essentially a rectangel of leather with an elastic band down the spine
to fasten notebooks inside, and another band that wraps around to keep
everything secure. It replaces any digital calendar or notes app or todo
app. It requires no charging, no username/password, and it syncs to
wherever you take it. Traveler's Company make a bunch of different
inserts, so it can be arranged and rearraged however you like. Currently
I have a week + memo diary in the front, a grid notebook in the back,
and a pocket in the middle.

### 5 metre 3.5mm-to-RCA cable

It cost next to nothing and it allows me to play music from my computer
or phone from anywhere in the room. While tech companies want to
convince you pay $$ for the latest wireless connectivity gadget, I get
pristine audio that never drops out.
